I am a physicist and data scientist.  After two postdocs, one in particle physics, the other in astronomy, I decided to take a year off to learn about data science. I now work as a Data Scientist in Montreal.  I am a co-organizer of Apache Spark Montreal Meetup, [check us out](http://www.meetup.com/Montreal-Apache-Spark-Meetup/)!
