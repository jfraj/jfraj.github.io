title: Lessons from Pycon 2015
---


I spent the last week at [Pycon](https://us.pycon.org/2015/) and the following coding [sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/) (working on scikit-learn).  Besides having my t-shirts drawer overfilled, I learned so much that I wanted to go back through my notes to crystallize my new knowledge.  Below are not summaries, but selections of knowledge nuggets collected from Pycon.

##Talks

###[Grid, Streets maps and pipelines: Building  linguistic Street map  with scikit-learn (Michelle Fullwood)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIFOTFdtK2k)
This talk was a straightforward example of a machine learning project, from the data collection, feature creation to fitting a classification model and its evaluation.
The project aims to classify street names into 6 'languages': Malay, Chinese, English, Indian, Generic and Other.
Here are the tools/tricks/information that I knew little or nothing about that I found interesting.

* Openstreet map providing geojson data of an metro area.
* geopandas for all the pandas utilities plus
 * geojson: gives access to geo data frame `df = geopandas.read_file('roads.geojson')`
 * easy to plot `df.plot()`
 * easy geometric operation `df = df[df.geometry.within(somearea.geometry)]`
* [N-grames]() as features to distinguish languages e.g. 'ck' is mostly for British names (as oppose to Chinese, Malay or Indian).  N-grams counters are determined
{% highlight python %}
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
ngram_counter = CountVectorizer(ngram_range(1,4), analyzer='char')
{% endhighlight %}
* Creating an interactive leaflet web map
{% highlight python %}
import mplleaflet
mplleaflet.display(...)
{% endhighlight %}
* Suggested paper about feature selection: [A few useful things to know about ML](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)

###[Good test bad test (Dan Crosta)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfR_QRoNZxo)
A clear set of guidelines that the speaker found useful over the years. The main message I got out of this is that tests are code too and therefore should be well designed and avoid complexity.  There was a section about the [mock package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock) and its limitations, but since I have no experience with it, I could not appreciate that part of the talk.  Here is what learned

* Test should be fast: slow test make you hesitate to do them
* One thing at the time: one assert per test
* Helpful fail message: what is actually brocken
* Some code should not be tested, e.g. testing stuff from internet queries: too many things could failed that are not related to your code.
* Consider shipping your code with [test doubles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double)

###[Facts and myths names & values (Ned Batchelder)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)
I first heard about Ned Batchelder the first day of the conference when I was suggested to watch one of his previous talk.  It did not take me long to appreciate the dense but didactic  format of his presentations.  I now follow him on twitter and plan to dive into his [blog](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/).  His talks are worth listening and re-listening.  In this one, the slides headers are facts about python.  In summary

* Names refer to values
* Assignment never copies data (no exception)
* Mutable aliasing: while for immutable objects change means reassignment, for mutable object it can mean modification of the pointed object. In Ned's word
  * A mutable value
  * more than one name
  * the value changes
  * all names see the change!
 In the snippet below, x and y point to the same list, so appending it changes it.
{% highlight python %}
x = [1,2]
y = x
x.appends(3)# x and y (pointing to the same list) see [1,2,3]
{% endhighlight %}

* Meaning of change is unclear: while for immutable objects change means reassignment, for mutable object it can mean modification of the pointed object:
  * For int: rebinding, `x = x + 1` a brand new intenger
  * For list: mutating, ` mylist.append(3)` *but* also rebinding mylist = mylist + [3] a *new list*
* Function arguments are assignments
{% highlight python %}
#this works
def append_twice(a_list, val):
  a_list.append(val)
  a_list.append(val)
nums = [1,2,3]
append_twice(nums, 7)# num = [1,2,3,7,7]
#this fails
def append_twice_bad(a_list, val):
  a_list += [val,val]
nums = [1,2,3]
append_twice_bad(nums, 7)# num = [1,2,3] did nothing
{% endhighlight %}
* Advice: don't mutate values in functions. Instead 1) make copy 2) mutate 3) return mutated copy
{% highlight python %}
def appenp_twice_good(a_list, val):
  """Returns new list."""
  a_list = a_list + [val, val]
  return a_list
nums = [1,2,3]
nums = appenp_twice_good(nums, 7)
{% endhighlight %}
* Names have no types; values have no scopes (made me pause... but nice when I got it!)
* [pythontutor.com](http://pythontutor.com) A great visualizer of the scope of your variable in a snippet you write!
* (From the questions) there is no way in python for a name to refer to another name
* (From the questions) A function default's mutable value is held by the function itself and will "stick around" and may "grow indefinitely and surprise you".

###[Other people's messy data (and how not to hate it!) (Mali Akmanalp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQ_8U5kruQ)
This was mainly an overview of the [Pandas package](http://pandas.pydata.org), but introduced two package I did not know about

* Accents in pandas with `encoding`, e.g.`pandas.read_csv('somefile.csv', encoding="utf-8")`
* Use [chardet](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet) to detect which encoding `chardet.detect(rawdata)`
* [fuzzyfuzzy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fuzzywuzzy) for string matching.  Below is an example where 96% of two strings are the same
{% highlight python %}
from fuzzyfuzzy import fuzz
fuzz.ratio("this is a test", "this is a test!")# returns 96
{% endhighlight %}
* [tabula](http://tabula.technology) for pdf to csv (java)
* [Blaze](http://blaze.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html) numpy- and pandas-like syntax for large data sets that your memory cannot hold.
* And of course, a reference to another Ned Batchelder's talk: [unicode sandwich](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain/unipain.html#35)

###[Exploring is never boring(Alison Kaptur)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSIRGLmQTLk)
About understanding the code base where it's easy to get lost.

* Suggested paper [How to read a paper](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf)
* Code is not literature: read as a naturalist
* inspect module (not for c-implemented) after `import inspect` do `print inspect.getsource([some_function])`
* for c-implemented stuff, use [cinspect](https://github.com/punchagan/cinspect)
* A cleaner history: earlier version of python are written in more readable C (then it got more complex for optimization).
* Look at change log (in mercurial): e.g. `hg blame Python/ceval.c`
* Experiment
  * test time `python -m timeit`
  * write tests/simulations

###[Hash Functions and You: Partners in Freedom(Curtis Lassam)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGwNQfjLTp0)
Just a nice talk that cleared some stuff about hashes and their concepts like bloom filters (hashing images).

* [Bloom filters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) as a space-efficient verification, where you only want to know if some data is in a set.
  * Is a user in our user list
  * Is an image banned
* Security: Not saving the password, but the hash.
  * Vulnerable to precomputed [dictionary attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack)
  * MD5 vulnerability revealed with [Bozocrack](https://github.com/juuso/BozoCrack) simple but clever by simply googling the hash... about 80% effective!
  * Don't use MD5

###[Advance git(David Baumgold)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EOZvow1mk4)
Beyond pull, push, checkout and merge. Git is just better understood with figures.  I'll re-watch it.

##Meeting people
Meeting people before and/or after e-meeting makes later discussion less formal.
Meeting occurred mostly at lunch where I usually sat a random tables and ask people about their work.
Here are some tips I got from discussions

* Refered talk [loop like a native](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html).
* Nice [Atom editor](https://atom.io) to take me to the 21st century.
* Time to switch to python 3

##Giving a lighting talks and watching the video: the (useful) horror
Since registration was onsite, I gave [3-minute talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVVMMULwR4s) (starting at 24:00).
As painful as seeing a video of myself can be, it will hopefully help me improve.
